The goal of this project is to build a GNU Radio block that implements
a Transport Stream to DVB-S2 Baseband Header conversion for the Digital
Devices Max SX8 DVB-S2(X) receiver.

Requirements:

A Digital Devices Max SX8 PCIe DVB-S2(x) receiver.

The block is intended to be connected to the IP Packet Sink block from
the gr-dvbgse project to provide DVB-GSE connectivity with the Max SX8
receiver. A test flow graph sx8gse.grc is provided in the apps directory.
